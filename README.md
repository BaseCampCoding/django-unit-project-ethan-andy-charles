# Project Proposal
## Gaming Forum with chat rooms

### Description and Motiation
In this project, we plan to have a forum where users can post, then other users can join chat rooms 
from that post, comments that are boosted can become suggestions for blog post. We've never seen a forum similar to this, and we think this would be a great idea.

### Prior Art
Rock Paper Shotgun, Minecraft Forums, anything with Forums.

### Core User Workflows
